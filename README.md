project overview :-
      This Java-based interactive recommendation engine is designed to emulate realâ€‘world recommender systems (e.g., product, content, or service recommendations). It applies foundational AI/ML techniques to deliver personalized suggestions based on user behavior, preferences, and item attributes.

Recommendation Engine:
       Collaborative Filtering (user- and item-based)
       Content-based Filtering using item attributes
Evaluation Module: Supports RMSE, MAE, and Precision/Recall metrics.
Modular Design: Easy to extend or swap algorithms for experimentation.
Demo App: (Optional) Command-line or simple GUI for simulation and testin
